    "In the \"100 game,\" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1..10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.\n",

    "    If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.\n",
    "    The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.\n",
    "    Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win."
