    "Could they be \"equal to\"? That would require some number M to appear both in the smaller and the larger half. It would be the largest in the smaller half and the smallest in the larger half. Examples again, where S means some number smaller than M and L means some number larger than M.\n",

Should be easy to see that in general, with n numbers, floor(n/2) times M is no problem. Now, if there were more M than that, then my method would fail. But... it would also be impossible:\n",

And to have the wiggle-property, all the other numbers would have to be larger. But then we wouldn't have an M in both the smaller and the larger half.\n",
